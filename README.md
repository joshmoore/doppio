Doppio: A JVM in TypeScript
=================================

_Doppio_ is a double shot of espresso.
In this case it's also a JVM written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

To try Doppio now, head to the [live demo page](http://int3.github.io/doppio/).

To learn more, head to the [Doppio wiki](https://github.com/int3/doppio/wiki).

You can also get in touch via our [mailing list][mail] or via the IRC channel
\#plasma-umass on Freenode.

Getting & Building the Code
---------------------------

    git clone https://github.com/int3/doppio.git
    cd doppio
    tools/setup.sh
    make

If you have Homebrew, `setup.sh` will try to install a bunch of dependencies
automatically. Users of other package managers should check that they have:

* `node >= 0.10`
* `wget`

Usage
-----

To run Doppio on localhost:

    make dev
    tools/server.coffee --dev

To get the optimized release version:

    make release
    tools/server.coffee --release

Then point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

To include your own code in the browser without manually uploading each file,
place your `.class` files in a directory under `classes/`,
then re-run `make dev` or `make release` to re-generate
the `listings.json` file.

For example:

    #in shell
    cp -ivR /path/to/my/class/files/ classes/my-classes/
    
    #in browser
    java -cp /sys/classes/my-classes my/package/MyClass  # use slashes, not dots, as package separators

We currently don't support loading class files from JARs in the browser,
but we intend to in the future. For now, unzip the JAR file and use the
above method to access the class files directly.

Doppio can also be run from the console. For example:

    make dev-cli
    node build/dev-cli/console/disassembler.js classes/demo/Fib
    # doppio-dev -> node build/dev/console/runner.js
    ./doppio-dev classes/demo/Fib
    ./doppio-dev classes/demo/Fib 7        # pass an argument to the JVM
    ./doppio-dev -jar my_application.jar   # extract and run a JAR

To get the optimized version, use `make release-cli`. The build products can be
found in `build/release-cli`, and the runtime can be invoked via `./doppio`.

Automated Rebuilding
--------------------

    bundle exec guard -i -g release # automates `make release-cli`
    bundle exec guard -i -g dev # automates `make dev-cli`

The front-end currently lacks an auto-rebuild system.

Running Tests
-------------

Run all tests:

    make test -j4

Run a specific test, or test with different options:

    node build/dev-cli/console/test_runner.js -h
    node build/dev-cli/console/test_runner.js classes/test/Strings
